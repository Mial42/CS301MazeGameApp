/**
 * A BasicRobot is a simple robot. 
 * A robot needs to be given an existing maze (a controller) to be operational.
 * It is configured by mounting distance sensors to a robot such that it can
 * measure the distance to an obstacle, a wall, in the direction that sensor
 * has been mounted on the robot.
 * It provides an operating platform for a robot driver that experiences a maze (the real world) 
 * through the sensors and actuators of this robot interface.
 * 
 * Note that a robot may be very limited in its mobility, e.g. only 90 degree left or right turns, 
 * which makes sense in the artificial terrain of a maze, and its sensing capability, 
 * e.g. only a sensor on its front or left to detect remote obstacles. 
 * Left/right is a notion relative to the robot's direction 
 * or relative to the underlying maze. 
 * To avoid a confusion, the latter is considered a direction in an absolute sense 
 * and it may be better to describe it as a cardinal direction 
 * north, south, east, west than up, down, right, left. 
 * 
 * A robot comes with a battery level that is depleted during operations 
 * such that a robot may actually stop if it runs out of energy.
 * This class supports energy consideration. 
 * A robot may also stop when hitting an obstacle.
 * The robot's distance sensors are subject to failures and repairs
 * such that the sensors may become temporarily unavailable 
 * during the robot's mission. 
 * 
 * WARNING: the use of CW_BOT/CW_TOP and CardinalDirection in
 * Floorplan and Mazebuilder does not directly match with the Map 
 * which draws position (0,0) at the lower left corner, such that 
 * x values grow towards the right, y values grow towards the top and
 * direction SOUTH is towards the top of the display. 
 * Or in other words, the maze is drawn upside down by the Map but
 * East and West are as one expects it (East to the right, West to the left).
 *  
 * The rotation is calculated with polar coordinates (angle) towards a 
 * Cartesian coordinate system where a southbound direction is (dx,dy)=(0,1).
 * 
 * Responsibilities: The robot's responsibilities are keeping track of
 * energy level and odometer reading, moving and turning, and combining
 * absolute location information (position and direction) with relative location
 * information (left/right/forward/backward and obstacle distance) from 
 * DistanceSensor.
 * 
 * Collaborators: a PlayingActivity that holds a maze to be explored,
 * a robotdriver class that operates robot, and a StatePlaying
 * that takes the inputs. This class uses DistanceSensors as well.
 * Cooperates with the program at large through a controller.
 * 
 * Note that interface methods do not have a Javadoc comment.
